# 🚦 Traffic Monitoring System 

This project is a Python-based **Traffic Monitoring System** that uses **definite integrals** from calculus to analyze and visualize traffic density over a given time interval. The system features an intuitive GUI built with `Tkinter`, real-time graph plotting using `Matplotlib`, and animated traffic flow simulations.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Definite Integration**: Calculates total traffic flow between two time points using `scipy.integrate.quad`.
- **Traffic Density Function**: Simulated with the function `f(t) = 10 + 5 * sin(t)`.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Live graph plotting of the density function.
- **Animation**: Real-time car movement animation based on density values.

## 💻 Features

- User-friendly GUI (Tkinter)
- Input time intervals for integration
- Matplotlib-based graph of the traffic density function
- Car movement animation representing flow rate
- Aesthetic background and visuals using `PIL.Image`
